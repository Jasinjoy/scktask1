# 📊 Internship Task 01 – Visualizing Data Distributions

This repository contains my first internship task where I explored the distribution of a variable using visualizations.

## 🔍 Task Objective
Create a **bar chart** or **histogram** to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable such as **age** or **gender**.

## 📈 What I Did
- Analyzed age distribution from a sample dataset
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Added **KDE curve** to show smoothed data density
- Identified key trends such as right-skewed distribution and age concentration

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most individuals are between **20–30 years old**
- Peak density occurs around **age 27**
- Fewer older individuals – skewed to the right

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 File
- `Task01_Distribution_Visualization.ipynb`: Notebook with full code and outputs

## 📌 Outcome
Strengthened understanding of data distribution patterns and visualization techniques using Python.
